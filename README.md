# WEBD 1000 - Exercise 9 

##  DEFINING A CSS GRID FOR OUR MULTI-PAGE WEBSITE
 
### Instructions:  

- Clone this repository to your local machine, make the required changes in the cloned folder during class, and **commit & push** the entire folder up to GitHub 
- You must ensure that your solution has been pushed to GitHub in order to get credit for the exercise.  
- SETUP: You should **copy in all of the files from your previous Exercise 6 folder** into this GitHub repository

### Important Note:

For the final project of this course, we will build an ePortfolio site (see a snippet of the Final Project Instructions below). For today’s exercise, we will continue developing our ePortfolio website structure.

### Tasks:  

#### Part A
See SETUP note above about copying in files from Exercise 6.

In NotePad++ (or the editor of your choice) reopen your Portfolio **Website** that you started in Exercise 3 & Exercise 6. Make the following changes:

 1. Create a new stylesheet called “_portfolio_layout.css_”.

	a. Link the new stylesheet into all (5+) HTML pages of your portfolio website, even if we will **primarily use it for the resume page today**. It will eventually hold all of our layout styles.

	b. DO NOT delete the links to the existing CSS file in your HTML pages.

	c. Set the charset to “UTF-8” on the first line of your new stylesheet.

	d. Put a CSS comment in the new stylesheet marking yourself as the author with today’s date.

2. Start adding some **actual content** to your **Resume** HTML page.
3. Have a container (e.g. &lt;section&gt;, &lt;div&gt;) for your resume and style it as a **CSS Grid** in your portfolio_layout.css page with your preferred number of columns and rows.
4. Place child elements in the resume in the appropriate Grid rows and columns.
 
#### Part B
Once the above Step is completed, validate **the “_portfolio_layout.css_” file** using the W3C **CSS** validation website. Take screenshot(s) showing successful validation and save them as image file(s) within the GitHub repository.
